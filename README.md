This repository publishes R codes to carry out topic modelling analysis using parametric and non-parametric mixture model and latent Dirichlet allocation.

Here, we apply the models to Associated Press dataset and, when considering parametric models, we implement log likelihood, perplexity, and adapted PMI, NPMI and LCP to choose the best number of topics.
